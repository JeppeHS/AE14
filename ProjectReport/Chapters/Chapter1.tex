\section{Introduction}
The following project experiments with different binary search algorithms. All our implementations takes a sorted static array of integers as input, search
this using a changing query value and returns the value if found or the next highest value in the array if not found.
The different implementations all have a setup method called createDataStructure and a search method called binSearch.
We only measure the execution of the binSearch methods as our implementations assume a static input array.

\section{Implementations}
The following four implementations of the binary search algorithm used four different memory layouts. The tree structures are shown in figure \ref{fig:memory_layouts}.

\subsection{Linear search}
To compare the running times for the algorithms, we have implemented a linear search function.
\begin{verbatim}
For each item in the list:
     if that item has the desired value,
         stop the search and return the item's location.
\end{verbatim}
 Return -1\footnote{We return -1 if the element dosn't exist in the list}.

\subsection{Inorder}

We have made a inorder binary search to compare with BFS, DFS and vEB.
Inorder is made iterative.
\lstinputlisting[language=C++, firstline=32, lastline=51, numbers=left]{./Figures/Project1/BinarySearch.cpp}
We begin by defining low, high and smallestSoFar.

In line 8 we make a while-loop, we run while high is greater than low.

We start by looking at the element whom is in the middle of the array.
If that element is smaller than the one we are looking for we set low to point at the middle +1.
If we are in the opposite case we set high to point at the middle -1.

The idea is that the array all the time is divided into one half the size where low will point at the first element in the new array and high will point at the last.

We continue until we find the element we are looking for or we return -1 if our list dosn't contain it.


\subsection{Breadth-first search (BFS)}
The following is a recursive method for filling out the bfs tree. The method is called by ``insert(0)''.
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=left]
void insert(int bfsIndex){
  if (bfsIndex >= SIZE) return;
  insert(2*bfsIndex+1); // Left child
  bfsArray[bfsIndex] = *(linArray+linIndex);
  linIndex++;
  insert(2*bfsIndex+2); // Right child
}
\end{lstlisting}


The binary search is then implemented as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=left]
  int i = 0;
  int curr = bfsArray[i];  // The current node visited
  int res = -1;  // The latest element smaller than 'elem'.
  while (curr != elem){
    i = 2*i+1;  // Left child
    if (curr < elem){
      i++;  // Right child (=left+1)
      res = curr;  // This is now the latest known element smaller than 'elem'.
    }
    // If we have reached a bottom node, return the last element lower than 'elem'.
    if (i >= SIZE){
      return res;
    }
    curr = bfsArray[i];
  }
  // At this point, the while loop did not continue because curr==elem
  return curr;
\end{lstlisting}



\subsection{Depth-first search (DFS)}
The implementation of depth first binary search (DFS) is based on \citep{binAlg}. 
The basic idea is to make a depth first traversal of the binary tree to create a different memory layout. 

The DFS implementation is build op like the other binary search implementations with a createDataStructure and a binSearch method. 
The createDataStructure sets op the given sorted array in a DFS fashion and saves it in a new array, dfsArr. 
The dfsArr is created through a recursive method called dfsInsert, that traverses the input array from left to right at insert in the dfsArr in a recursive manner. 
The dfsInsert method simulate traversal of the DFS tree and at each iteration of the tree-depth the method inserts the current element from the input array and then calls dfsInsert on it's left and right children. 
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=left]
void dfsInsert(int dfsIdx, int atDepth, int * inputArr) {
	if (dfsIdx < dfsArrSize && atDepth <= treeHeight) {
		int offset = floor(pow(2, (treeHeight - atDepth)));
		atDepth++;
		
		// Go left;
		dfsInsert(dfsIdx + 1, atDepth, inputArr);
		
		// Insert self	
		dfsArr[dfsIdx] = inputArr[insertFrom];
		insertFrom++;
		
		// Go right
		dfsInsert(dfsIdx + offset, atDepth, inputArr);
	}
} 
\end{lstlisting}
The left child is found by simply iterating one and the calculated offset is used to find the left child. 
We observed that there is a relationship between two to the power of heght of the tree and the current tree depth and index of the right child, 
and use this in the calculation of the offset.   

Making the actual binary search in the created DFS tree is done with the same way as in the other algorithms, but also keeping track of the our current depth.
The highest value seen so far (lower than what we are looking for) is maintained and then the array is traversed like a binary tree. 
The main difference in DFS is what each time we need to visit the right child we calculate the offset in same way as in createDataStructue.  
But here shifting bits instead of using pow to save computation time (It could also been done this way in createDataStructue, but we use pow to ease the understanding). 
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=left]
 ...
// Go right
node = node + (1<<(treeHeight-atDepth));
...
\end{lstlisting}



\subsection{Van Emde Boas (vEB)}

The vEB array is constructed using the following recursive method. It is called using ``insert(0,0,0,roots)'' where roots is an array of the same size as the depth of the tree.

\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=left,escapeinside={@}{@}]
void insert(int vebIndex, int atDepth, int depthIndex, int roots[]){
  if (vebIndex >= size || vebIndex < 0) {
    return;
  }
  int rootIndex = findPosition((~atDepth+1) & atDepth); // returns the position of the rightmost 1-bit in "atDepth".
  int depthType = findPosition(~atDepth & (atDepth+1)); // returns the position of the rightmost 0-bit in "atDepth".
  int rootsNew[depth];
  for (int i=0; i<depth; i++){
      if (i <= rootIndex) rootsNew[i] = vebIndex;
      else rootsNew[i] = roots[i];
  }
  int amount = 1<<((1<<depthType)-1);  // 2^(2^depthType - 1)
  @\label{lst:vebLeft}@int vebLeft = (2*(depthIndex & (amount-1)) +1) * (2*amount -1) + rootsNew[depthType];  // (2*(depthIndex % amount)+1) * 2^(2^depthType) + "The root of the smallest local subtree"  insert(vebLeft, atDepth+1, 2*depthIndex, rootsNew); // Left child
  vebArray[vebIndex] = *(linArray+linIndex);
  linIndex++;
  int vebRight = vebLeft + 2*amount -1;
  insert(vebRight, atDepth+1, 2*depthIndex+1, rootsNew); // Right child
}
\end{lstlisting}

This vEB structure does not depend on the size of the input array. As a consequence, only inputs of size $2^{2^n}-1$ where $n$ is an integer generates fully balanced trees.
Otherwise it will always be more or less unbalanced, where the most of weight is located to the left. If for example the size is 9 then the left side will contain 7 elements compared to only 1 on the right side.
If we go one ``tree order'' further, if the size is 135, then there will be eight subtrees of size 15 each located to the of the root. That is, there will be 142 elements to the left of the root versus only 7 to the right.
In these two examples, almost half of the tree structure would not be utilized. Consequently, searching will on average require more iterations than balanced tree, since the tree is higher.
The worst case for this type of layout happens when the input size is $k 2^{2^n}$ where $2 < k \ll 2^{2^n}$. Then, more than half of the elements are located in the lower half of the tree, while at the same time, the tree is much higher than in a balanced tree.

The index calculation in line \ref{lst:vebLeft} is quite complex.
Some of the variables leading up to this calculation are illustrated in figure \ref{fig:vEB}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./Figures/Project1/vEB.eps}
		\rule{35em}{0.5pt}
	\caption[Van Emde Boas construction]{
	Bla bla bla.
	}
	\label{fig:vEB}
\end{figure}

First we do \verb!depthIndex&(amount-1)! which calculates how far to the right we are in the relevant subtree.
Then we double this value to find the number of new subtrees already placed by the neighbouring nodes to the left. One is added to take the current subtree into acount.
That value is now multiplied by the size of the current subtrees which is \verb!2*amount-1! to get the index of the left child in the parenting subtree.
Finally we add the index of root of the parenting subtree.


The binary search is implemented as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=left]
  int vebIndex = 0;
  int curr = vebArray[vebIndex]; // The current node visited
  int res = -1; // The latest element smaller than 'elem'.
  int atDepth = 0;
  int depthIndex = 0;
  int roots[depth];
  for (int i=0; i<depth; i++){
      roots[i] = 0;
  }
  while (curr != elem){
    int rootIndex = ... // same as above
    int depthType = ...
    int amount = ...
    
    for (int i=0; i<=rootIndex; i++){
	roots[i] = vebIndex;
    }
    int goRight = curr < elem;
    vebIndex = (2*(depthIndex & (amount-1)) +1 + goRight) * (2*amount -1) + roots[depthType];

    if (goRight){
      res = curr;  // This is now the latest known element smaller than 'elem'.
    }
    if (vebIndex >= size || vebIndex < 0){
      return res;  // we have reached the bottom of the tree.
    }
    atDepth++;
    depthIndex = 2*depthIndex + goRight;
    curr = vebArray[vebIndex];
  }
  // At this point, the while loop did not continue because curr==elem
  return curr;
\end{lstlisting}
